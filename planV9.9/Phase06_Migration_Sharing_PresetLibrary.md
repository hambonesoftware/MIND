# Phase 06 — Migration + Sharing + Preset Library

## Owner agents
Primary: agent_backend, agent_frontend, agent_docs  
Support: agent_qa, agent_orchestrator

## Objective
Make presets shareable and old content survivable:
- Built-in preset library (20–40 curated)
- Save preset + recent presets
- Migrate existing thoughts to preset codes

---

## Deliverables
- Curated preset list with names + purpose
- Copy/paste sharing UX
- Migration mapping old -> PS2 fields + generatorVersion stamps

---

## Testing
- Old projects open and play after migration
- Preset library codes compile and sound distinct
- Sharing round-trip across sessions reproduces output

---

## Success checklist
- [ ] Preset library exists and is curated
- [ ] Save/recent works
- [ ] Migration does not break existing content
