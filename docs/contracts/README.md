# Contracts (authoritative)

Contracts are the source of truth for the MIND Protocol and Thought authoring structures.

Rules:
- Contracts are versioned and immutable: never rename/remove keys.
- Enum values may be extended only if the contract marks them as extensible.
- Code must use canonical key strings from immutables, not ad-hoc literals.
