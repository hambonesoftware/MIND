# What’s New in V9.5

- **Custom Melody Editor:** Graphical latch strip with holds, per-bar presets, copy/paste, and aligned note inputs—no more typing `9..-` strings.
- **Runtime Support:** Backend compilation for custom melodies with holds/ties and schema defaults for melodyMode/customMelody.
- **Moonlight Treble Template:** One-click Start → Intro → Triplets & Melody graph with seeded rhythm/notes for quick validation.
- **Playback Polish:** Play button gating when Start is disconnected, reduced console spam via rate-limited logging, and clearer executions panel status (now-playing info).
- **Docs:** Added phase notes, validation steps, and consolidated test matrix for release sign-off.
