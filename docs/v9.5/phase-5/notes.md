# Phase 5 — Custom Melody Editor UI

- Added Melody Mode selector on Thought nodes with a dedicated Custom Melody panel when selected.
- Custom melody grid selector normalizes bar rhythms to the chosen step count to prevent corruption.
- Bar picker tracks the selected bar per thought so edits persist while navigating between bars.
- Step strip editing enforces rhythm length and auto-cleans stray holds; note fields resync to note-on count.
- Copy/paste, copy-previous, and Preset A/B helpers accelerate authoring repeated bar motifs.
