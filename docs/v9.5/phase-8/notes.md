# Phase 8 — Moonlight Treble Template & Validation

- Template action (Inspector → Templates) inserts Start → Intro → {Triplets, Melody} with pre-positioned nodes for clarity.
- Melody thought is custom with 12 bars initialized; bar 1 is pre-seeded with Rhythm Preset A and starter notes (`C#5 E5 G#5 E5`) for quick playback validation.
- Triplets and Intro use 1/12 grid, Melody uses 1/16 grid to match latch editor defaults.

_Validation run not executed in this environment; see validation checklist for manual steps._
