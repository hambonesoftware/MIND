# Codex Prompt — V9.5 Phase Runner

You are working inside the MIND repo. Implement **Phase 5** from planV9.5.

Rules:
- Only change files listed in the phase.
- Keep diffs minimal.
- Run tests specified by the phase and report results.
- Write artifacts into `docs/v9.5/phase-5/`.
- If you encounter an assumption mismatch, stop and document it instead of guessing.

Phase goal:
Frontend: Graphical Custom Melody Editor

Success checklist:
- Step strip editor works
- Presets/copy/paste
- Notes assignment

When done, output:
- list of files changed
- tests run + results
- a short summary of behavior changes
