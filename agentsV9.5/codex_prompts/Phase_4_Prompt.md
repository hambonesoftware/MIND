# Codex Prompt — V9.5 Phase Runner

You are working inside the MIND repo. Implement **Phase 4** from planV9.5.

Rules:
- Only change files listed in the phase.
- Keep diffs minimal.
- Run tests specified by the phase and report results.
- Write artifacts into `docs/v9.5/phase-4/`.
- If you encounter an assumption mismatch, stop and document it instead of guessing.

Phase goal:
Backend: Compile Custom Melody to Events

Success checklist:
- Custom melody produces events
- Holds/ties work
- sourceNodeId tagged

When done, output:
- list of files changed
- tests run + results
- a short summary of behavior changes
