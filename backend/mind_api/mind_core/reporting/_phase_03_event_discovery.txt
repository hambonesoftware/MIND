Phase 03 event discovery

Event definitions
- backend/mind_api/models.py: class Event with fields tBeat, lane, note (alias), pitches, velocity, durationBeats.

Compilation path
- backend/mind_api/mind_core/compiler.py builds Event objects and sets durationBeats based on sustain steps.
- backend/mind_api/mind_core/lattice.py converts lattice onsets into Event objects with durationBeats derived from dur_steps.

Render/scheduling touchpoints
- backend/mind_api/mind_core/post/strum.py offsets tBeat and shortens durationBeats accordingly.
- backend/mind_api/mind_core/post/perc.py emits events with durationBeats set per pattern.
- backend/mind_api/mind_core/reporting/moonlight_report.py reads tBeat and durationBeats for comparison output.
