Phase 03 sustain semantics notes

Changes
- Added sustain policies in motions/sustain.py:
  - hold_until_change: start tones on chord-change steps and hold until the next change.
  - pedal_hold: start tones on chord-change steps and hold until the next pedal lift (or bar end).
- Updated solver sustain motion to build stepwise harmony and pass policy + pedal lift steps to apply_sustain.

Tests
- pytest -q backend/tests/test_sustain_semantics.py

Usage notes
- sustain(policy=hold_until_change) uses HarmonyPlan chord changes as boundaries.
- sustain(policy=pedal_hold,pedal_lifts=12) holds tones through chord changes until the specified lift step.
