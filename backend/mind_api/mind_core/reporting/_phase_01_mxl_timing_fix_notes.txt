Phase 01 - MusicXML timing fix notes

Changes
- Reset the chord-onset tracker when <backup> or <forward> elements move the measure cursor so chord stacks cannot leak across voice repositioning.
- Added unit tests covering <backup>, <chord/>, and <forward> timing behavior using planV7.3 fixtures and an inline XML example.

Tests
- pytest -q backend/tests/test_mxl_parser_timing.py

Assumptions
- Chord stacks are represented by consecutive <note><chord/></note> entries without intervening <backup>/<forward>.
- Measure-level cursor adjustments should invalidate prior chord onset context.
